Description: This package implements a multiple testing procedure which addresses the challenge of controlling error rates at multiple levels of resolution. We frame this problem as the selection of hypotheses which are organized in a tree structure. The procedure controls relevant error rates (in particular, the selective FDR in each level of the tree) given certain assumptions on the dependence among the hypotheses.
